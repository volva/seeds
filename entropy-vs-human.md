# Entropy vs. Human

Consider two facts about sources of entropy in computing:

* In order to take decisions based on random judgement, computers need sources of entropy.
* Week sources of entropy cause computers to take predictable decisions in such situations.

If we subject human beings catalogued as computers, will the facts above hold? 
To assert, we need to ask smaller questions. Here are some from the top of my head:

* How selection of different sources of entropy affects decision making in humans?
* Do and how changes in entropy cause changes in making decisions?
* Does "consumption" of the same sources of entropy cause making the same mistakes, or making the same decisions over and over?
* Can we use sources of entropy to stimulate education process? 
  How would such stimulation compare to traditional, structured education programs?

These, and certainly many other questions shall be answered in relation to reference area.
Answers in relation to many independent references must be provided in order to obtain meaningful conclusions.

## Expectations

If the facts hold against human beings, it would be thrilling to distinguish entropy as something essential 
in decision making process. We could think of dividing sources of entropy into categories, depending on the 
impact they have on human brain and human behavior. The catalogue of course can't be too concrete, for it 
would lead to order, the exact opposite of entropy :). By categories I mean three primary ones, like 
**positive**, **neutral** and **negative** entropy. Another way to categorize it would be by emotional
impact. Think of **joyful** or **sad** entropy. Doesn't it sound a little bit like hashtags on social 
sharing websites?
